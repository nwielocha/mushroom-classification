# Mushroom Classification
As a project and training I have made a complete classification of mushrooms, using different preprocessing methods and classifieres. Full documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/nwielocha/mushroom-classification/blob/main/Mushroom%20Classification.ipynb). Whole project took my about 2 weeks to complete.
